# US-states-game
A simple game, where your goal is to guess all the states of U.S.

This is another project, which I took, while going through '100 Days of Code' course on udemy.

HOW TO PLAY:
As stated in the beginning. This is a simple game, where your goal is to guess all the states of U.S. If you want to exit the game you can type exit into the window. When you decide to finish the game, the game will create CSV file with all the states, that you didn't manage to guess.
